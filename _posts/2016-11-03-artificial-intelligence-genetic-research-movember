title: Using Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Research to support Movember
---
*by Syed Rizvi and Karl Smith Byrne*  
  
This November, in addition to growing our moustaches we have decided to put our technical skills to good use to support the spirit 
of [Movember](https://uk.movember.com/mens-health/prostate-cancer "Prostrate Cancer: The Facts"). 
We have designed a project that uses artificial intelligence and genetic research to predict the risk and incidence of 
prostate cancer in men. 

Karl and I are researchers at the University of Oxford. After having a conversation about how we both wanted to move beyond academic research and have more meaningful, direct impact on helping people live healthier lives, we knew we what we had to do and this project was the result of combining our individual strengths. 

## The project

### Using Artificial Intelligence to predict prostate cancer

A central issue in the prediction of cancers using molecular biomarkers is the sheer size of the data; with hundreds of thousands of genetic variants, many possible protein biomarkers, and common lifestyle and socio-demographic factors, statistical methods have yet to fully adapt. We require a way to integrate inherited risk with lifestyle factors in a way that provides clinicians with interpretable information for direct use.

In the current project we aim to address these challenges using advanced machine learning techniques especially deep learning, on genetic and protein biomarker data to design a test to help clinicians identify prostate cancer earlier and with greater specificity by providing information on their five-year risk. One of our key objectives is to provide a personalised result for each patients - to on average predict a given man’s risk well, not to predict well the average man - and so we will combine these molecular data with other pertinent information on height, body fat composition, and lifestyle habits.

We consider each of these sources of information (genetic, lifestyle, etc) as snapshots of a man’s risk of prostate cancer. For example,  we are born with our genetic risk and can, at least in principal, make a prediction from birth for the risk of a whole host of diseases; however, we may also receive information during his lifetime on many important factors, and so we can and should learn, update our predictions and test them as we receive new information. 

The technology we are trying to deploy in the face of this challenging issue  the cutting edge artificial intelligence algorithms that are being used to run driverless cars, to analyse financial markets, to program smart AI assistants, and in detecting asteroids that are a risk to earth, all of which specialise in robustly integrating vast quantities of information from differing domains in real time, and help inform human decision making.

We hope that we can harness this same power to challenge the hard problem of predicting the risk of prostate cancer in men. We want our predictions to be meaningful and actionable, so that clinicians can use them to save lives.

Our research is open source, so that other scientists can build upon our work to advance the prediction of prostate cancer. The aim of our project is to bring together the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Genetic research and create algorithms that help improve people’s lives.

### The team

This project was started by [Syed Rizvi](http://www.saarizvi.com/ "Syed Rizvi's homepage") (Machine Learning Research Group) and [Karl Smith Byrne](https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/team/karl-smithbyrne "Karl Smith Byrne - Nuffield Dept of Population Health") (Nuffield Department of Population Health) to bridge the gap between cutting edge Artificial Intelligence research and Global Health sciences.

Syed Rizvi is a Rhodes Scholar from Pakistan. He has been doing a PhD at the Machine Learning Research Group at University of Oxford, under Prof. Stephen Robert supported by funding from Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance. Since 2012, Syed's research has focused on using artificial intelligence techniques for predicting financial market volatility, and analysing how information travels between different financial markets. Before starting the PhD, Syed worked as an Instrumentation Engineer in Pakistan, and studied for a BEngg in Electronics Engineering at National University of Sciences and Technology. 

Karl Smith Byrne is a Clarendon Scholar from Dublin. He has been doing a PhD at the Nuffield Department of Population Health at University of Oxford, under Associate Professor Ruth Travis and Professor Tim Key. Karl began his research at the Cancer Epidemiology Unit in 2014 supported by the Clarendon Fund. Prior to beginning his doctoral research, he read for an MPhil in Biological Anthropology at the University of Cambridge, with a thesis on population genetics at Jesus College, and studied for a BSc in Psychology at the University of Dundee.

### Incidence of prostate cancer

According to [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/prostate-cancer/incidence#8XByEiF2YHX1cjMg.99 "Accessed on 02 Nov, 2016"), prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in the UK and there were 47,300 new cases of prostate cancer in 2013 alone! That is more than twice the size of the [whole student population of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/about/facts-and-figures/student-numbers?wssl=1 "22,602 according to Oxford University Student Statistics website on 02 Nov, 2016"). 

[1 in 8 men](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/prostate-cancer/incidence#8XByEiF2YHX1cjMg.99 "According to Cancer Research UK, accessed on 02 Nov, 2016") will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime and around the world 1.11 million men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012! That is roughly 9 times the total [population of Oxford](https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20131/population/459/oxfords_population "According to Oxford City Council, accessed on 02 Nov, 2016").

These statistics make it clear that it is a worthwhile challenge and a problem that needs to be tackled with all the resources we can muster.

### Respect for the problem and research that has come before

Going into this challenge we are mindful of the fact that many, many smart and talented people have conducted valuable research in this area before us. We are by no means trying to say that this artificial intelligence approach will hold all the answers or that this approach will succeed where previous methods have failed. It is possible that we will hit the same walls that others have come up against, but our sincerest hope is that we will hit new walls and find the next level challenges that have so far remained out of reach of the previous research in this field. 

## How can you help?

First and foremost, please contribute to the [Movember Foundation](https://uk.movember.com/ "Movember Foundation Homepage") by giving donations to people around you who are taking part in the challenge. 

Check out our github repository and raise issues if you find any bugs.

Give us suggestions for improving our methodology whether in terms of experiment design, data techniques or the artificial intelligence algorithms that we are using.
