title: Using Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Research to support Movember
---
*by Syed Rizvi and Karl Smith Byrne*  
  
This November, in addition to growing our mustaches we have decided to put our technical skills to good use to support the spirit 
of [Movember](https://uk.movember.com/mens-health/prostate-cancer "Prostrate Cancer: The Facts"). 
We have designed a project that uses artificial intelligence and genetic research to predict the risk and incidence of 
prostrate cancer in men. 

Karl and I are researchers at the University of Oxford. After having a conversation about how we both wanted to move beyond academic research and have more meaningful, direct impact on helping people live healthier lives, we knew we what we had to do and this project was the result of combining our individual strengthts. 

## The project

### Using Artificial Intelligence to predict prostrate cancer

In this project we will use advanced machine learning techniques especially deep learning, on genetic data to design a test to help clinicians in combating prostrate cancer. The test will predict the risk of an individual developing prostrate cancer within the next three years of their life. The genetic data will be combined with other biomarkers such as height, body fat composition, and lifestyle habits, in order to give personalized results for patients because each individual is unique and any prediction test must take these individual traits into account. 

The technology we are trying to deploy in the face of this challenging issue are the cutting edge artificial intelligence algorithms that are being used to run driverless cars, to analyse financial markets, to program smart ai assistants, and in detecting asteroids that are a risk to earth etc.

We hope that we can harness this same power to challenge the hard problem of predicting the risk of prostrate cancer in men. We want our predictions to be meaningful and actionable, so that clinicians can use them to save lives. 

Our research is open source, so that other scientists can build upon our work to advance the prediction of prostrate cancer. The aim of our project is to bring together the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Genetic research and create algorithms that help improve people's lives. 

### The team

This project was started by [Syed Rizvi](http://www.saarizvi.com/ "Syed Rizvi's homepage") (Machine Learning Research Group) and [Karl Smith Byrne](https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/team/karl-smithbyrne "Karl Smith Byrne - Nuffield Dept of Population Health") (Nuffield Department of Population Health) to bridge the gap between cutting edge Artificial Intelligence resarch and Global Health sciences. 

Syed Rizvi is a Rhodes Scholar from Pakistan. He has been doing a PhD at the Machine Learning Research Group at University of Oxford, under Prof. Stephen Robert supported by funding from Oxford-Man Institue of Quantitative Finance. Since 2012, Syed's research has focused on using artificial intelligence techniques for predicting financial market volaitility, and analysing how information travels between different financial markets. Before starting the PhD, Syed worked as an Instrumentation Engineer in Pakistan, and studied for a BEngg in Electronics Engineering at National University of Sciences and Technology. 

Karl Smith Byrne is a Clarendon Scholar from Dublin. He has been doing a PhD at the Nuffield Department of Population Health at University of Oxford, under Associate Professor Ruth Travis and Professor Tim Key. Karl began his research at the Cancer Epidemiology Unit in 2014 supported by the Clarendon Fund. Prior to beginning his doctoral research, he read for an MPhil in Biological Anthropology at the University of Cambridge, with a thesis on population genetics at Jesus College, and studied for a BSc in Psychology at the University of Dundee.

### Incidence of prostrate cancer

According to [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/prostate-cancer/incidence#8XByEiF2YHX1cjMg.99 "Accessed on 02 Nov, 2016"), prostrate cancer is the second most common cancer in the UK and there were 47,300 new cases of prostrate cancer in 2013 alone! That is more than twice the size of the [whole student population of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/about/facts-and-figures/student-numbers?wssl=1 "22,602 according to Oxford University Student Statistics website on 02 Nov, 2016"). 

[1 in 8 men](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/prostate-cancer/incidence#8XByEiF2YHX1cjMg.99 "According to Cancer Research UK, accessed on 02 Nov, 2016") will be diagnosed with prostrate cancer during their lifetime and around the world 1.11 million men were diagnosed with prostrate cancer in 2012! That is roughly 9 times the total [population of Oxford](https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20131/population/459/oxfords_population "According to Oxford City Council, accessed on 02 Nov, 2016").

These statistics make it clear that it is a worthwhile challenge and a problem that needs to be tackled with all the resouces we can muster.

### Respect for the problem and research that has come before

Going into this challenge we are mindful of the fact that many many smart and talented people have conducted valuable research in this area before us. We are by no means trying to say that this artificial intelligence approach will hold all the answers or that this approach will succeed where previous methods have failed. It is possible that we will hit the same walls that others have come up against, but our sincerest hope is that we will hit new walls and find the next level challenges that have so far remained out of reach of the previous research in this field. 

## How can you help?

First and foremost, please contribute to the [Movember Foundation](https://uk.movember.com/ "Movember Foundation Homepage") by giving donations to people around you who are taking part in the challenge. 

Check out our github repository and raise issues if you find any bugs.

Give us suggestions for improveing our methodology whether in terms of experiment design, data techniques or the artificial intelligence algorithms that we are using.
