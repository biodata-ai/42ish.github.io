title: Using Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Research to support Movember
---

This November, in addition to growing our mustaches we have decided to put our technical skills to good use to support the spirit 
of [Movember](https://uk.movember.com/mens-health/prostate-cancer "Prostrate Cancer: The Facts"). 
We have designed a project that combines artificial intelligence and genetic research to predict the risk and incidence of 
prostrate cancer in men. 

After having a conversation about how we both wanted to move beyond academic research and have more meaningful, direct impact on helping people live healthier lives, we knew we what we had to do and this project was the result of combining our individual strengthts. 

### The project
In this project we will use advanced machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks, on genetic data to design a test to help clinicians in predicting the risk of an individual developing prostrate cancer within the next three years. The genetic data will be combined with other biomarkers such as height, body fat composition, and lifestyle habits, in order to give personalized results for patients because each individual is unique and any prediction test must take these individual traits into account. 

Our research is open source, so that other scientists can build upon our work to advance the prediction of prostrate cancer. 

### The team

We are researchers at the University of Oxford. This project was started by [Syed Rizvi](http://www.saarizvi.com/ "Syed Rizvi's homepage") (Machine Learning Research Group) and [Karl Smith Byrne](https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/team/karl-smithbyrne "Karl Smith Byrne - Nuffield Dept of Population Health") (Nuffield Department of Population Health) to bridge the gap between cutting edge Artificial Intelligence resarch and Global Health sciences. 

Syed Rizvi is a Rhodes Scholar from Pakistan. He has been doing a PhD at the Machine Learning Research Group at University of Oxford, under Prof. Stephen Robert supported by funding from Oxford-Man Institue of Quantitative Finance. Since 2012, Syed's research has focused on using artificial intelligence techniques for predicting financial market volaitility, and analysing how information travels between different financial markets. Before starting the PhD, Syed worked as an Instrumentation Engineer in Pakistan, and studied for a BEngg in Electronics Engineering at National University of Sciences and Technology. 

Karl Smith Byrne is a Clarendon Scholar from Dublin. He has been doing a PhD at the Nuffield Department of Population Health at University of Oxford, under Associate Professor Ruth Travis and Professor Tim Key. Karl began his research at the Cancer Epidemiology Unit in 2014 supported by the Clarendon Fund. Prior to beginning his doctoral research, he read for an MPhil in Biological Anthropology at the University of Cambridge, with a thesis on population genetics at Jesus College, and studied for a BSc in Psychology at the University of Dundee.

### Incidence of prostrate cancer

According to [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/prostate-cancer/incidence#8XByEiF2YHX1cjMg.99 "Accessed on 03 Nov, 2016"), prostrate cancer is the second most common cancer in the UK and there were 47,300 new cases of prostrate cancer in 2013 alone! That is more than twice the size of the [whole student population of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/about/facts-and-figures/student-numbers?wssl=1 "22,602 according to Oxford University Student Statistics website on 03 Nov, 2016").
