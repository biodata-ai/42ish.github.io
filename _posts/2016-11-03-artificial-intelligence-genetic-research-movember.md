title: Using Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Research to support Movember
---

This November, in addition to growing our mustaches we have decided to put our technical skills to good use to support the spirit 
of Movember. 
We have designed a project that combines artificial intelligence and genetic research to predict the risk and incidence of 
prostrate cancer in men. 

In this project we will use advanced machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks, on genetic data to design a test to help clinicians in predicting the risk of an individual developing prostrate cancer within the next three years. The genetic data will be combined with other biomarkers such as height, body fat composition, and lifestyle habits, in order to give personalized results for patients because each individual is unique and any prediction test must take these individual traits into account.
